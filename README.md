# Financial Ratios Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes financial data from three key sectors: Real Estate, FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods), and Tech, over the period from 2018 to 2021. The primary focus is on two important financial metrics:

- **Profitability Ratios**: Indicating the efficiency of a company in generating profit from its revenue.
- **Leverage Ratios**: Indicating the extent of debt a company has relative to its equity.

The analysis is divided into several parts, focusing on sector-wise comparison, leverage-profitability correlation, and trends over the years. The project also provides insights into the reasons behind sector performance variations using visualizations and statistical analysis.
